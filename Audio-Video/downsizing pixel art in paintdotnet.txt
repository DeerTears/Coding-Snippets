downsizing tests on aliased sprites with gradients:

my goal was to find the downscaling method that didn't introduce new colours or compression artifacts into the image while keeping an even distribution of colours in a gradient going across long 4-pixel passages.

bilinear is the worst and compresses images like they're meant for facebook. bad quality, horrendous compression.

bicubic does the job well but divides the gradients in uneven ways while losing a lot of the original colours in the gradient. okay quality, good compression.

supersampling is the best mix of disregarding unneeded gradient colours while keeping the gradients evenly distributed. no visible compression artifacts. good quality, good compression.

fant is good at keeping more colours and compressing in un-noticable ways, but it's not as even with downsized gradients. good quality, okay compression.

nearest neighbour squishes everything together to try and keep all the quality it can in a small resolution but it uses the most colours to do it. for clean-looking pixels this is the 2nd worst option. bad quality, bad compression.
